# ECU-RETRO-WORK

## Challenges:
* **1.Frequent ECU module failure** due to badly designed wiring harness mounting and this causes fouling of harness with nearby body structure and resulting sort circuiting with body ground and ultimatetly ECU failure.
* **2.ECU harness failure** due to badly designed wiring harness mounting and this causes fouling of harness with nearby body structure and resulting harness failure. Also due to poor routing of harness, they comes in contact with too much of heat from radiator & engine exhaust system, dust due to it is mounted below radiator which always comes in contact with direct air when vehicle in motion and during radiator cleaning lots of water is also comes in contact with it which accelerates corrosion on connectors and wires.
* **3.Engine harness failure** due to badly designed wiring routing and lack of spares available, mounting of wiring onto there assigned bracket is very difficult and sometimes not possible due to lack of spares availability. Also poor maintenance is another cause of failure too. Thus these all issues will result in fouling of harness with engine or nearby components and thus failure occured.

**These all above issues also adds up together and causes major spares losses and due to breakdowns, revenue is also badly affected due to lesser vehicle uptime and availability.**
