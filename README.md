# ECU-RETRO-WORK

## Challenges:
* **1.Frequent ECU module failure** 
 * a)Failure due to external damages -- Observed ECU failure due to external supply induced over ECU body and thus failure occurs.
 * b)Failure due to badly designed routing of ENGINE HARNESS AND ECU HARNESS -- This causes fouling of harness with nearby body structure and resulting sort circuiting with body ground and ultimatetly ECU failure.

* **2.ECU harness failure** 
 * a)Failure due to badly designed wiring harness mounting -- this causes fouling of harness with nearby body structure and resulting harness failure.
 * b)Failure due to poor routing of harness -- Loosed harness fouls with other components and resulting failures.
 * c)Failure due to heat, dust and water -- When harness end connectors comes in contact with too much of heat from radiator & engine exhaust system, dust-as it was mounted below radiator which always comes in contact with direct dusty air when vehicle in motion and during radiator cleaning or rainy season lots of water is also comes in contact with connector which accelerates corrosion on connector pins and wires. 

* **3.Engine harness failure** 
 * a)Badly designed wiring routing and mounting points -- This a major cause of failure as wiring fouls with other components.
 * b)Lack of mounting bracket spares availability -- Mounting of wiring onto there assigned bracket is very difficult and sometimes not possible due to lack of spares availability. 
 * c)Also poor maintenance is another cause of failure too. 

  Thus these all issues will result in fouling of harness with engine and nearby components and thus failure occured.

**These all above issues also adds up together and causes major spares losses and due to breakdowns, revenue is also badly affected due to lesser vehicle uptime and availability.**

## Solution:
* **1.ECU module**

 * a)Designed a cover in house to protect ECU from external damages. It is made of fiber glass using polyster resin and is manufactured in house as well. Ventilation holes are provided over the top for sufficient cooling.
 * 
 * b)Modification done on both ENGINE HARNESS and ECU HARNESS mouning points and rerouting is done.

*  **2.ECU harness** 
  * a)Mounting points are modified and extra support brackets are installed with eliminates any fouling with nearby body structure.
  * b)Routing is modified which eliminates fouling with any nearby body structure and with extra protection from near by sharp objects by covering them with insulating sleeve pasted using high strength silicon compound.
  * c)Connector is moved away from below radiator area which completely eliminates, heat coming from radiator & engine exhaust system, dust-as it is now in a much closer space and far from direct contact with dusty air due to vehicle movement and water due to radiator washing and from rain water during raining seasons.

*  **3.Engine harness** 
  * a)Routing of wiring harness is changed to imporve safety and longevity of harness and mounting points is impoved by providing extra mounting points.
  * b)Newly designed brackets are made in house to eliminate issue of lack of spares availability as we now not depend on other vendors for brackets.
  * c)Training is provided to electricians so that maintenance quality will improve as well.
